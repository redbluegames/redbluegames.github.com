  description: "Sparklite is a roguelite brawler-adventure for PCs and consoles.
It’s set in a whimsical world where players invent guns and gadgets to solve
puzzles and defeat enemies. It is an “approachable roguelike”, borrowing the
procedural content and randomness from roguelikes like Rogue Legacy and
combining it with the appeal of classic titles like Zelda.
<br/><br/>
Players adventure across the world as Ada, a genius engineer lost in a strange
new land thrown into turmoil by gremlins extracting the last of the world’s
sparklite. But nature is fighting back. Violent earthquakes, called disruptions,
shake up the terrain, periodically causing new arrangements for the world. After
each disruption comes new quests, minigames, and challenges for the player to
overcome as she builds up her strength to defeat the Baron.

  history: "Sparklite is Red Blue Games' first major title and has been in
  development for two years. We are a studio of three based out of Durham, NC,
  founded in 2013 by twin brothers Edward and Lucas and later joined by Kevin in
  2015. Edward and Kevin both came from Vicious Cycle based in Raleigh, where
  they worked on third and first-party games like Earth Defense Force: Insect
  Armageddon, Eat Lead, and Kung Fu Panda. Lucas came from the web industry,
  leaving his job as QA Engineer at Lulu.com to start Red Blue Games. Our
  company’s philosophies are shaped by this combination of experiences in the
  web and game industries."
