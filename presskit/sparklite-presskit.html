  description: "<p>Sparklite is an action-adventure set in the whimsical and
    ever-changing land of Geodia. Battle foes in top-down action using an arsenal of
    gadgets, guns, and gear. Explore dangerous corners of the procedurally generated
    world, take down titans of the mining industry, and harness the power of
    Sparklite!</p>

    <p>Everything in the world of Geodia is tied together by Sparklite... it's the life
    force of the planet, and the inhabitants have learned how to channel it safely.
    The blue, glowing ore can be harnessed providing a low-level, rechargeable power
    source. Or, for those brave or greedy enough, it can be consumed for a surge of
    power with grave consequences. Geodia’s self-titled \"Baron\" has devised a plot
    to mine the world’s Sparklite core to meet his own ends. Mining Sparklite in
    large quantities, the Baron repurposes the ore to fuel his powerful war
    machines, but the pollution from the consumed Sparklite is corrupting the world.
    Animals have turned into violent monsters, and the environment is rotting away.</p>

    <p>The stricken land of Geodia has a natural defence in its Sparklite core.
    Periodically, the core causes Fractures which rearrange the world, setting
    back the Baron’s efforts. Our hero, Ada, must stop the Baron before he can
    obtain the core and gain the power to create a new world in which he has
    ultimate power. A plucky mechanic, Ada will need to use her cunning and skills
    to defeat the Baron’s henchmen across five distinct zones. Ada will have to work
    with Geodia’s weird and wonderful inhabitants if she’s to face the Baron and put
    paid to his deadly plans before it’s too late.  Our hero, Ada, must travel to
    each zone of the world to shut down the Baron’s Digsites before it’s too late...</p>"

  history: "Sparklite is Red Blue Games' first major title and has been in
  development for four years. We are a studio of three based out of Durham, NC,
  founded in 2013 by twin brothers Edward and Lucas and later joined by Kevin in
  2015. Edward and Kevin both came from Vicious Cycle based in Raleigh, where
  they worked on third and first-party games like Earth Defense Force: Insect
  Armageddon, Eat Lead, and Kung Fu Panda. Lucas came from the web industry,
  leaving his job as QA Engineer at Lulu.com to start Red Blue Games. Our
  company’s philosophies are shaped by this combination of experiences in the
  web and game industries."
