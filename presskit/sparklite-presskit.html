  description: "Sparklite is a brawler-adventure with procedural world generation.
  Battle foes in top-down action using an arsenal of gadgets, guns, and gear. Explore
  dangerous corners of a whimsical world, take down titans of the mining industry, and
  save the Sparklite!
<br/><br/>
  Everything in the world is tied together by <b>Sparklite</b>... it's the life force
  of the planet, and the inhabitants have learned how to channel it for their
  own gain. It can be harnessed, or it can be consumed for a surge of power with
  grave consequences.
  <br/><br/>
  <b>The Baron</b> has devised a plot to mine the world’s Sparklite core. He mines
  Sparklite and burns/consumes it to fuel his powerful war machines, but the
  pollution from the consumed Sparklite is corrupting the world. Animals have
  turned to violent monsters, and the environment is rotting away. But the world
  has a natural defense in its Sparklite core. Periodically, the core causes a
  Disruption which rearranges the world, setting back the Baron’s efforts. If
  the Baron can obtain the core, he will gain the power to create a new world
  where he has ultimate power.

  history: "Sparklite is Red Blue Games' first major title and has been in
  development for four years. We are a studio of three based out of Durham, NC,
  founded in 2013 by twin brothers Edward and Lucas and later joined by Kevin in
  2015. Edward and Kevin both came from Vicious Cycle based in Raleigh, where
  they worked on third and first-party games like Earth Defense Force: Insect
  Armageddon, Eat Lead, and Kung Fu Panda. Lucas came from the web industry,
  leaving his job as QA Engineer at Lulu.com to start Red Blue Games. Our
  company’s philosophies are shaped by this combination of experiences in the
  web and game industries."
