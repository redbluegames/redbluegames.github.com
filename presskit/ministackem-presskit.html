  history: "Mini Stackem is the third of the Red Blue Minigames. These minigames
    are designed to be bite-sized experiences that allow for a minimal degree of
    depth in the form of competitive leaderboards and achievements. We believe
    that while the tricks that many free to play games use may increase engadgement,
    they ultimately don't make for better player experiences. As mobile gaming
    has become increasingly crowded with poor quality free games, our minigames are
    an attempt to raise the bar by creating fundamentally sound, polished,
    miniature games."
