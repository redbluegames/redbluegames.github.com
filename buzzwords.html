      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      At its core, Buzzwords is a team game that pits friends against friends
      in cutthroat wordplay action. Here are the basics:</br>
      <ul>
        <li>Divide all players into teams of two or more.</li>
        <li>Each turn, a team assigns a presenter who must try to get their
          team to guess as many secret words as possible without saying
          certain 'buzz' words.</li>
        <li>An opposing player enforces the list of 'buzz' words.</li>
        <li>Points are awarded for each successfully guessed word.</li>
        <li>The team that has the most points at the end of the game
          wins!</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sample Game</h2>
      Sally and three of her close friends are out camping and realize they
      forgot to bring any games. But Sally comes to the rescue and pulls out
      her Android phone with Buzzwords! The group praises her foresight and
      excitedly divides up into two teams of two.</br>
      </br>
      Sally opens the app and taps Play to enter the Game Setup screen.
      The group divides into two teams, yellow and green, and Sally
      highlights those colors.</br>
      Since they want to each play 4 times they set it to 8 rounds
      (#teams X #rounds = #turns). Sally taps Start Game to play.</br>
      Sally starts off presenting for the Yellow Team and Rob, sitting to
      her left, monitors Sally on behalf of the Green Team.  Sally's first
      word to present is Sandwich, which includes the 'buzz' words bread,
      butter, eat, lunch, and sub. She starts by saying,
      <blockquote>'OK...this is something you eat for lunch.'</blockquote>
      Rob, who is an astute buzzer, calls her out on her multiple
      transgressions and Sally is forced to hit the X button.</br>
      Sally unfortunately can't get her team to guess the next word and time
      runs up. Her turn totals an embarassing -1 points.</br>
      But Sally is given a chance for redemption. She passes the phone to
      her right, to Zack on the Green team and then looks over his shoulder
      to call him out.</br>
      She's so on top of it that Zack ends up with -3 points. The group
      decides to cut him a break and on the Turn Results screen they change
      one word to a "skip", making him only lose his team 2 points.</br>
      Zack passes the phone to his right and assumes the monitoring role,
      eager to exact his revenge.</br>
      And the excitement continues until the friends see the glimmer of
      dawn and realize they've had WAY TOO MUCH FUN!</br>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <h5>What age range is the game appropriate for?</h5>
      We designed the game to be appropriate for children. But it is a game
      that revolves around the clever use of the English language, after all,
      so it is likely going to be more fun for mature children and adults.</br>

      <h5>Is it okay to say a buzz word after a guesser has used it?</h5>
      Yes. As long as a guesser says the word before the presenter, the word
      is then fair game for the presenter to use it. This allows presenters
      to chain clues up to the word that they are trying to get people to
      guess.</br>

      <h5>Can the presenter substitute in nonsense words for buzz words?</h5>
      Definitely. Just be reasonable about it -- don't use anything close
      to the word you are substituting. For example, don't replace buzz
      words with nonsense words that rhyme with the buzz words or have the
      same number of syllables. Really, it's best to just use something like
      "blank" or "blah" to avoid any unfair leading.</br>

      <h5>Skipping is lame. Can we prevent people from doing it?</h5>
      Yes, because some households (not ours) frown upon skipping, we made
      it so that you can disable skipping from the Settings screen.
      Additionally, under <i>Advanced House Rules</i> you can change the points
      that skipping (and right and wrong) adds or subtracts.</br>

      <h5>If a buzz word or guess word is an acronym are we allowed to say
      any of the words the acronym stands for?</h5>
      A good, but admittedly broad, rule of thumb is if the game is
      trivialized by a certain behavior, it's probably not allowed. So the
      short answer is no. The game would be too easy if people could turn buzz
      words into acronyms or just say what an acronym stands for.</br>

      <h2>Open Source Game</h2>
      We love Open Source software and want to do our part to foster
      sharing within the game community. Part of the reason we decided to develop
      for Android first instead of iOS was because the platform is <i>mostly</i> open.</br>
