# Maintenance Notes
Github uses Jekyll to publish these pages. You will be best served
referring to the Github and Jekyll documentation where setup and
configuration issues are concerned.

## Our Workflow

Always make sure to edit the files within directories prefixed by an
underscore _ as these will not be stomped when Jekyll builds.

Always edit .less files since we use Less to compile our stylesheets
into single, minified files.
